The PN532 Zephyr driver is an out-of-tree module supporting the NXP PN532 NFC module. It (will eventually) provides a transport-agnostic (I2C, SPI, UART) interface with a custom API, selectable via Kconfig, offering functionalities such as reading and writing NFC tags and initiating peer-to-peer communication with extensibility for further NFC operations.

## ✅ TODO

- [x] Build a minimal working driver with a single API

- [x] Add build CI + README badge

- [x] Add release CI + README badge

- [x] Add a unit test project to the module

- [x] Add test CI running on `native_sim` board + README badge

- [x] Add code coverage CI using `codecov` + README badge

- [ ] Implement the `get_firmware_version` functionality using I2C transport

- [ ] Add the other relavant missing APIs to the driver

- [ ] Add documentation using GitHub pages and MkDocs material and docs deploy workflow + badge
